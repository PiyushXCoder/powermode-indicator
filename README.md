# Powermode Indicator

It is a plugin for all desktops supported by libappindicator. It provides menu to choose power profiles.

I do use it on my system. I would love to see contributions and bug reports. 

> It depends on [power-profile-daemon](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/power-profiles-daemon/)
